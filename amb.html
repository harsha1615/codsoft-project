        <h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, in the town of Mhow in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India. He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal and Bhimabai Murbadkar Sakpal. Born into a Dalit family, Ambedkar faced severe discrimination and social ostracism from a young age. Despite these challenges, his father, a retired army officer, emphasized the importance of education, which laid the foundation for Ambedkar's later achievements.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar was a brilliant student, overcoming immense social barriers to pursue higher education. He attended Elphinstone High School in Mumbai, where he was the only Dalit student. After completing his education in India, Ambedkar went on to study at Columbia University in New York, where he earned a Master's degree in Economics. He later pursued studies at the London School of Economics and obtained a doctorate. Ambedkar's academic achievements were groundbreaking, especially for someone from a marginalized community.</p>
<h2>Major Contributions</h2>

<h3>The Indian Constitution</h3>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar is best known as the principal architect of the Indian Constitution. As the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, he played a pivotal role in framing a Constitution that ensured justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens. His vision was to create a society where social inequalities would be eradicated and everyone would have equal opportunities.</p>

<h3>Social Reforms</h3>
<p>Ambedkar was a staunch advocate for the rights of the Dalits (formerly known as Untouchables) and other marginalized communities. He fought against the caste system and worked tirelessly to promote social equality. One of his significant contributions was the introduction of reservations (affirmative action) in education and government jobs for Dalits and other oppressed groups, providing them with opportunities that were previously denied.</p>

<h3>Economic Thought</h3>
<p>Ambedkar was also a visionary economist. He advocated for land reforms, labor rights, and the welfare of workers. His contributions to economic planning in India were crucial, and his ideas on the redistribution of wealth and resources were ahead of their time. Ambedkar’s work emphasized the need for economic empowerment of the poor and marginalized sections of society.</p>
