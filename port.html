        <p style="background-color: aliceblue;"><i><h4>What is AI?
            Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Examples of AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.
            
            As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have scrambled to promote how their products and services incorporate it. Often, what they refer to as "AI" is a well-established technology such as machine learning.
            
            AI requires specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is used exclusively in AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia are all popular languages among AI developers.
            
            How does AI work?
            In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states.
            
            This article is part of
            
            A guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise
            Which also includes:
            10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024
            10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024
            The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years
            For example, an AI chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, and an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. Generative AI techniques, which have advanced rapidly over the past few years, can create realistic text, images, music and other media.
            
            Programming AI systems focuses on cognitive skills such as the following:
            
            Learning. This aspect of AI programming involves acquiring data and creating rules, known as algorithms, to transform it into actionable information. These algorithms provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks.
            Reasoning. This aspect involves choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
            Self-correction. This aspect involves algorithms continuously learning and tuning themselves to provide the most accurate results possible.
            Creativity. This aspect uses neural networks, rule-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, text, music, ideas and so on.
            Differences among AI, machine learning and deep learning
            The terms AI, machine learning and deep learning are often used interchangeably, especially in companies' marketing materials, but they have distinct meanings. In short, AI describes the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence, while machine learning and deep learning are specific techniques within this field.
            
            The term AI, coined in the 1950s, encompasses an evolving and wide range of technologies that aim to simulate human intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning enables software to autonomously learn patterns and predict outcomes by using historical data as input. This approach became more effective with the availability of large training data sets. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, aims to mimic the brain's structure using layered neural networks. It underpins many major breakthroughs and recent advances in AI, including autonomous vehicles and ChatGPT.
            
            Why is AI important?
            AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks traditionally done by humans, including customer service, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control.
            
            In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. It is especially useful for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are properly filled in. AI's ability to process massive data sets gives enterprises insights into their operations they might not otherwise have noticed. The rapidly expanding array of generative AI tools is also becoming important in fields ranging from education to marketing to product design.
            
            Advances in AI techniques have not only helped fuel an explosion in efficiency, but also opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, for example, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis on demand, yet Uber has become a Fortune 500 company by doing just that.
            
            AI has become central to many of today's largest and most successful companies, including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which use AI to improve their operations and outpace competitors. At Alphabet subsidiary Google, for example, AI is central to its eponymous search engine, and self-driving car company Waymo began as an Alphabet division. The Google Brain research lab also invented the transformer architecture that underpins recent NLP breakthroughs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>

            <p  style="font-size: larger;"><i>Image classification is the task of classifying and assigning labels to groupings of images or vectors within an image, based on certain criteria. A label can be assigned based on one or more criteria. Image classification can be: single-label.<br>The most popular image classification model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are neural network architectures that use machine learning concepts to learn and train from data without human intervention.<br> CNNs are inspired by human neurons and use filters and convolution layers to process images. These layers create a feature map of the image based on the pixels it represents, which is then processed as a matrix of elements. 
CNNs have multiple layers that perform specific functions, including an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer: <br>
<center style="font-size:20px">Input layer: Receives input from the user <br>
Hidden layer: Contains neurons that process the input from the input layer<br> 
Output layer: Processes the data and provides the output</center>
